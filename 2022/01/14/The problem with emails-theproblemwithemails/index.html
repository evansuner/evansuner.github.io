<h2 id="Transcript"><a href="#Transcript" class="headerlink" title="Transcript"></a>Transcript</h2><p><strong>ONE:</strong><br>Simon: Good morning listeners and welcome to our weekly programme, Communicating Across Cultures. Today we are talking about emails - problems we can have when writing emails across cultures. I’m joined in the studio by Dr Wendy Woo, a cross cultural trainer. Welcome Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>TWO:</strong><br>Simon: Good morning listeners and welcome to our weekly programme, Communicating Across Cultures. Today we are talking about emails - problems we can have when writing emails across cultures. I’m joined in the studio by Dr Wendy Woo, a cross cultural trainer. Welcome Wendy.</p>
<p>Wendy: Thank you, Simon and hello to everyone. I’m sure we’re going to have an interesting discussion this morning.</p>
<p>Simon: Yes, we’ve had lots of requests from listeners to talk about misunderstandings when emailing across cultures.</p>
<p>Wendy: Well, that’s not surprising. Emails are difficult, even between people from the same cultural group. When we communicate electronically we don’t have all the support that we have when we communicate face to face. I mean things like body language, facial expressions and voice, intonation and so it’s easier to read them in the wrong way, misunderstand the message.</p>
<p>Simon: And so many different ways to write emails, too. We have these two examples from our listener, John, which we have posted on our website for everybody to see.</p>
<p>Wendy: These are great examples of different communication styles. We have one where the writer is very direct and the other which some people might call long-winded.</p>
<p>Simon: So, my first question is; can we put it all down to culture? Can we say that the styles are different because the writers are from different cultural backgrounds?</p>
<p>Wendy: Well, we have to be careful. We don’t want to stereotype people and say that this person writes in a particular way just because they are from a particular culture.</p>
<p>Simon: Yes, that’s true.</p>
<p>Wendy: We have to think about the relationship between the writer and the reader, what kind of day the writer is having and so on. But what we can say is that where we come from does influence what we think is a polite or impolite way to communicate.</p>
<p>Simon: So, our cultural background affects the way we write emails, but it is not the total answer?</p>
<p>Wendy: That’s correct. We can look at general tendencies. But we can’t be too simplistic about it and say, for example, all British people do this, and all Chinese people do that.</p>
<p>strong&gt;Simon: So, what can we do to make sure we communicate effectively with people across cultures?</p>
<p>Wendy: Have you heard of the STOP method?</p>
<p>Simon: STOP method? What’s that?</p>
<p>Wendy: Well S is easy, it stands for stop. By that I mean stop before you react. If you get an email and you feel it is impolite or not right, don’t reply when you are feeling angry or upset. Wait.</p>
<p>Simon: Good advice.</p>
<p>Wendy: T is for think. Sometimes it helps just to spend more time thinking about what the person is saying.</p>
<p>Simon: OK. Stop, think and O?</p>
<p>Wendy: O is for observe. I mean look closely at the email, look at what you have both said or written to each other in the past.</p>
<p>Simon: Right, yes, it’s important to put things in context.</p>
<p>Wendy: Basically, the more information you have, the better. And finally P is for position. Try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes, see the world from their point of view.</p>
<p>Simon: OK, so stop, think, observe and position, STOP. I think that’s really good advice.</p>
<p>Wendy: Well, knee jerk reactions just make things worse. And then it’s out there, for all to see. It’s better to respond to an email in a considered way.</p>
<p>Simon: That’s very true. So what should employers do to help their employees communicate better through emails?</p>
<p>Wendy: Well, companies that have a multicultural workforce or do business across cultures need to give their staff some cultural training. I think it is also important that companies develop policies and guidelines for their staff around emails.</p>
<p>Simon: You mean like a list of dos and don’ts?</p>
<p>Wendy: Yes, it’s very helpful for employees to have a list of guidelines or suggestions for what to say and how to say it. If everyone is referring to the same list, it makes misunderstandings less likely to happen.</p>
<p>Simon: Well, that’s all we have time for today. It’s been a great discussion and you’ve given us some helpful ideas, Wendy. Thanks very much.</p>
