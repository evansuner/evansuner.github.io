<li>The rainbow was very <em style="color:green;">accessible</em> because viewers could see it from all over for free.</li>
<li>An <em style="color:green;">original</em> idea is one that nobody has thought of before.</li>
<li>The <em style="color:green;">iconic</em> song ‘Somewhere over the Rainbow’ is well known for its association with the film The Wizard of Oz.</li>

<li>If something is <em style="color:green;">bold or dramatic</em>, it can have quite an impact.</li>
<li>Art which is <em style="color:green;">imple or minimalist</em> is just the opposite, but can still have an impact. Some people prefer this type of art.</li>
