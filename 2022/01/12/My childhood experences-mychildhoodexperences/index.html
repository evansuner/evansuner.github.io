<li>Takahiro<br>I had to study really hard when I was at school. I was a straight-A student growing up, but my mother thought I needed more challenges, so I had to play chess, basketball and the piano. I never really had any free timel But I didn’t have to do any chores, either. I remember trying to clean the floor once, and it was a complete disaster: two inches of water on our beautiful parquet boards. When my mother saw this, I was never permitted to help her again.</li>
<li>Kasia<br>When I was small, my big brother and I had to share a room. We were not allowed to stay up late, but I really loved the bedtime stories my brother used to tell me. He would sit on my bed and whisper so that mum and dad wouldn’t hear. But he didn’t tell me about kings, queens, or spaceships. Our favourite story was about a famous Polish writer who had supposedly met my brother and given him a special magical TV as a present. Of course, my brother was forbidden to show it to anyone, but he could describe it: it had a tiny glowing screen with buttons, which showed all the TV channels in the world and could also play music and send messages to people. I know, you’re thinking ‘smartphone’ - but it was almost 40 years ago!</li>
<li>Salvador<br>When I went to primary school, my dad worked as a chemistry teacher with older students. He had to take me home after my lessons were over, but on some days he had a chemistry lab, which finished a bit later. So I would sit and wait for him at the door. This was the most exciting time ever. Sometimes<br>there were strange smells and vapours coming through the door crack; once I even heard a small explosion! The students ran out of the lab, wide-eyed and excited. Years later, when I needed to choose what I was going to do in the future, I didn’t hesitate one second. I became a firefighter.</li>
