<h3 id="How-well-do-you-get-along-with-your-family-members"><a href="#How-well-do-you-get-along-with-your-family-members" class="headerlink" title="How well do you get along with your family members?"></a>How well do you get along with your family members?</h3><p>I get along well with my family, but sometimes there are small conflicts and I try my best to deal with them. The methods are as follows：</p>
<p>Talk about it – try chatting about what’s going on in your life with a family member in a time and place where they’re open to listening.</p>
<p>Take time to listen – when you start a conversation be open to listening to the other person’s ideas and suggestions.</p>
<p>Build trust – it takes time and effort to build trust in relationships - even with family! Start with sharing small things and work your way up.</p>
<p>Spend time together – spend quality time with family doing everyday things. It can help strengthen or build on the connection you share.</p>
<p>Take a break – it’s OK to take time out. Let your family know you want some alone time and that you’ll re-join them when you’re feeling ready.</p>
<p>Learn to negotiate – think about what you need and what the other person needs. Try to meet in the middle so both people are happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>Problem solve - try to find solutions that make everyone happy. Get creative - there’s usually lots of different ways to solve a problem.</p>

<h3 id="What-was-the-most-recent-family-event-you-attended"><a href="#What-was-the-most-recent-family-event-you-attended" class="headerlink" title="What was the most recent family event you attended?"></a>What was the most recent family event you attended?</h3><ul>
<li><p>When and where was it?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Who did you go with?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Who did you meet there?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Time flies really fast, and the event, that took place a year ago, seems like happened only a week ago or so. In fact, I can still vividly remember the day when I celebrated a happy new year with all of my family members about a few years ago.</p>
<p>However, before that day though, I and my family had wanted to celebrate a happy reunion of the entire family for quite some time, but it just didn’t happen because we don’t live together.I live in overseas because my studies and the expensive flight tickets. But, we saw a great window of opportunity to have a family celebration as soon as a new year.</p>
<p>Anyway, since it was a rare opportunity, we all wanted to make our family reunion a memorable event by celebrating a happy new year together at a nearby restaurant. So, on the eve of New Year, we all went to the restaurant and ordered our favourite food and desserts. Once, our food fests were over, we decided to head to our home and watch some of our old family videos in order to revisit our lovely and happy past as children. At the end of our reunion, I felt like the celebration was long overdue as we all enjoyed our time to the fullest.</p>
<p>It was really important for me and my family to attend this celebration because it helped us understand the value of my family like never before. Besides, it also gave us an opportunity to relax and have some fun with the entire family after a tiring and long work year.</p>
