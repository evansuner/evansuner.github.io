How？"></a>Does technology make your life easier? How？</h3><p>There is little doubt that technology impacts strongly on our world today. It has become a significant part of all our lives, making many things easier and quicker. However, mordern technology can sometimes affect us and our families in negative ways.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;">On the positive side</span>, mordern technolory saves many innocent lives. <span style="color:red;">For example</span>, medical science has found cures for diseases. It <span style="color:red;">has alse</span> allowed transplats of kidneys, hearts and even faces. Without brain scanners, lasers, radioactive chemicals and computers we would not have the standard of healthcare that we have today. <span style="color:red;">On the top that</span>, mordern technology has made industry more infficient, on the other sidee of the world and freed us from daily chores.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;">However</span>, technology <span style="color:red;">has a number of disadvantages</span>. <span style="color:red;">For instance</span>, the more technology advances, the lazier we become and offen the more unsociable we become. We order junk food online and we play sports on screens not in fields. We may <span style="color:red;">also</span> be able to communicate with people on the side of the world <span style="color:red;">but</span> we often forget how to talk with people in the same room as us. <span style="color:red;">In addition</span>, we have become too dependent on mordern technology <span style="color:red;">and</span> we think morden medical care solve all our health problems instead of eating well and exercising regularly.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;">To sum up</span>, there are ways in which technology has a negative impact on our lives tooday, but  <span style="color:red;">in my opinion</span> the fault is not the technologu itself but how we use it. We must balance how we use technology and understand that it can have disadvantages. Technology can improve so many things we want to do and allow us to do so many new thins but it’s important jut to use it intelligently and carefully.</p>
